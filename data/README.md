# Data Directory

This directory contains both real historical data and synthetic CSV output.

## Data Sources

### Real Historical Data (`data/seed/`)
- **`price_quotes.csv`**: Real daily closing quotes from 2021-present via Yahoo Finance
- **`fx_rate_daily.csv`**: Real USD/EUR exchange rates from 2021-present
- Generated by `scripts/fetch_stock_prices.py`
- Regenerate with `python scripts/fetch_stock_prices.py --force` whenever you need a fresh dataset; the loader no longer falls back to legacy `price_daily.csv`.

### Synthetic Data (`data/seed/`)
- **`users.csv`**, **`orgs.csv`**, **`accounts.csv`**: Identity and account scaffolding for compatibility paths
- **`journal_entries.csv`**, **`journal_lines.csv`**: Source-of-truth double-entry ledger powering dashboards
- **`trades.csv`**: Stock trades with 70% portfolio coverage across small/medium/large investors
- **`instruments.csv`** & **`instrument_identifiers.csv`**: Stock/ETF definitions and identifiers (ISIN, tickers, etc.)
- Generated by `scripts/gen_seed_data.py`

## Data Generation

You can safely delete generated files; they will be recreated on the next run.
The quickstart process automatically fetches historical data and generates synthetic data.

Check the README in the project root for generation parameters and tips on
sizing the dataset for demos.
