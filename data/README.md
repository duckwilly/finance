- Generated by `scripts/fetch_stock_prices.py`

### Synthetic Data (`data/seed/`)
- **`users.csv`**, **`orgs.csv`**, **`accounts.csv`**: User and account data
- **`transactions.csv`**: Synthetic bank transactions with realistic patterns
- **`trades.csv`**: Stock trades with 70% portfolio coverage across small/medium/large investors

### Live Data (`data/stream/`)

## Data Generation

You can safely delete generated files; they will be recreated on the next run.
The quickstart process automatically fetches historical data and generates synthetic data.

Check the README in the project root for generation parameters and tips on
sizing the dataset for demos.
