        <li>This is a financial dashboard that simulates a bank's clients. We model companies, individuals, and their cash and stock transactions. We built a web platform where users can view, search, and analyze their financial data.</li>

      <h3 class="slide__section-title">Scope and functionality</h3>
      <ul class="slide__bullets">
        <li><strong>Server-rendered dashboards:</strong> All dashboards are rendered server-side with Jinja2 templates. We use SQLAlchemy ORM queries to populate them.</li>
        <li><strong>Search and filtering:</strong> Admins can search and filter across all data.</li>
        <li><strong>Dynamic dashboards:</strong> The ORM layer is structured so dashboards and charts can be built dynamically. More on this later.</li>
        <li><strong>Easy setup:</strong> The entire project can be built in one go with <code>make quickstart</code>.</li>
