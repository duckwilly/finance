# Finance Platform (Rebuild)

This repository hosts the reboot of a FastAPI-driven finance platform. The
previous admin dashboards have been removed so the application can be rebuilt
around a cleaner architecture that separates APIs, services, models, and data
access. The data-generation and database tooling remain intact, enabling the new
application code to reuse the same rich dataset once the APIs are implemented.

## Status
- ✅ New application scaffold under `app/` with routers, services, schemas,
  models, and database utilities stubbed for future development.
- ✅ Shared logging utilities preserved under `app/core/log` and re-exported via
  `app.core.logger` and `app.log` for backwards compatibility.
- ✅ CI, Makefile, and quickstart script updated to focus on database seeding and
  automated tests instead of launching the now-removed dashboards.
- 🚧 API routes, business logic, and templates will be implemented in follow-up
  work.

## Tech Stack
- Python 3.11+
- FastAPI (application framework)
- SQLAlchemy (database access)
- MariaDB via Docker Compose
- Alembic (migrations placeholder)
- Pytest (tests)
- Faker & CSV scripts for synthetic data generation

Additional top-level directories provide SQL schema, scripts for generating seed
CSV data, Docker Compose definitions, and automated tests.

## Getting Started

### Quickstart (recommended)
The quickest way to replicate the CI workflow locally is:

```bash
make quickstart
```

The script will:
1. Create a Python virtual environment (if missing).
2. Install the dependencies listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Launch MariaDB using Docker Compose.
4. Wait for the database to become available.
5. Apply `sql/schema.sql`.
6. Run the database smoketest and generate seed CSV files.
7. Load the seed data into MariaDB.

Because the web frontend is being rebuilt, the script stops after preparing the
infrastructure and prints a reminder about running `uvicorn app.main:app`
manually once routes are implemented. Install `uvicorn` separately when you are
ready to iterate on the API.

### Running Tests

```bash
pytest
```

The new tests validate that the FastAPI application factory wires the placeholder
router and that configuration defaults are loaded from the environment.

### Manual Setup (optional)
If you prefer to perform the steps yourself:
1. Create a `.env` file (or copy `.env.example`) with the database credentials
   used by Docker Compose.
2. Start MariaDB: `docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yaml up -d`.
3. Create & activate a virtual environment, then install dependencies.
4. Apply the schema: `mysql -h 127.0.0.1 -uroot -proot finance < sql/schema.sql`
   (or run the statements in your SQL client).
5. Smoke test connectivity: `python scripts/db_smoketest.py`.
6. Generate and load seed data using `python scripts/gen_seed_data.py` followed by
   `python scripts/load_csvs.py`.

Once API endpoints exist, install `uvicorn` and launch the application with
`uvicorn app.main:app` (the Makefile no longer starts a server automatically).

## Synthetic Data & Tooling
The data generation scripts continue to provide a comprehensive dataset covering
individuals, companies, transactions, and stock trades. Adjust the parameters in
`scripts/gen_seed_data.py` to create lighter or heavier workloads, then reload
with `scripts/load_csvs.py`. These scripts rely on the shared configuration and
logging modules preserved during the rebuild.

## Next Steps
- Flesh out domain models in `app/models/` and their accompanying schemas.
- Implement service-layer logic that aggregates financial metrics.
- Introduce FastAPI routers for admin, company, and individual dashboards.
- Add Alembic migrations to replace the raw SQL schema.
- Expand automated tests alongside new features.
